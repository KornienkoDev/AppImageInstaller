## Features

-   🖱️ **Right-Click Integration**: Install or uninstall AppImages directly from your file manager (Thunar, Nautilus, Dolphin, etc.).
-   🧹 **Clean Management**: Automatically moves files to `~/Applications` and organizes icons.
-   🔄 **Smart Updates**: Re-running the installer updates the existing application without creating duplicates.
-   ⚙️ **GUI & CLI**: Works seamlessly via mouse clicks or terminal commands.

----------

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3 installed on your system.
-   Standard Linux desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.).

### Quick Setup

1.  Download `appimage_installer.py` and `install.sh` and place them in the same folder.
    
2.  Open your terminal in that directory and run the setup script:
    
    ```bash
    bash install.sh
    ```
    
3.  **Restart your File Manager** for the changes to take effect.


## Usage

### Option A: Graphical Interface (Right-Click)

#### To Install

1.  Right-click any `.AppImage` file.
2.  Select **Open With** > **AppImage Installer**.
3.  A terminal window will display the installation progress.
4.  Once finished, the application appears in your system menu!

#### To Uninstall

1.  Right-click the `.AppImage` file (you can use the original downloaded file).
2.  Select **Open With** > **AppImage Uninstaller**.
3.  The tool will locate the installed version and remove the app, icon, and menu entry.

----------

### Option B: Command Line

If you prefer using the terminal, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Install an AppImageappimage-installer --install /path/to/application.AppImage# Uninstall an AppImageappimage-installer --uninstall /path/to/application.AppImage
```

----------

## File Locations

The tool organizes your applications in the following directories:


| Type | Location |
|--|--|
| **Apps** |'~/Applications/'  |
| **Icons**| `~/.local/share/icons/Applications/'|
| **Shortcuts**| `~/.local/share/applications/`|
----------

## Troubleshooting

**"AppImage Installer not showing in Open With menu"**

1.  Ensure you ran the setup script: `bash install.sh`.
2.  Make sure you **restarted** your file manager.
3.  Check the "Other Application" submenu in the "Open With" dialog.

**"Command not found: appimage-installer"**
 Ensure the symlink was created during setup. 
 Run: sudo ln -sf ~/.local/bin/appimage-installer /usr/local/bin/appimage-installer
    

**"Application is not appearing in the menu"**

1.  This usually happens if the AppImage contains a `TryExec` line that checks for system binaries that don't exist.
2.  This script automatically removes `TryExec` lines to fix this. If the issue persists, check the `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications/` manually.
